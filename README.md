# Car-Park-Tracker
A Windows Application to track vehicle registrations in a large city car park.

You have accepted the role of a Contract Programmer for CITE Managed Services working to create a car park tracking and billing system for a company called Active Systems Pty. Your task is to create a prototype program to demonstrate to the client how the program can track vehicle registrations in a large city car park. In this task you will create a new Windows Application to collect and process the vehicle registration information. The program is a simulation which takes data from a camera and reads the registration plates of each vehicle that enters and leaves the car park. Your prototype will also read and write data to a file as part of an archive and audit process. The basic operations will be manually operated using a series of buttons. If the prototype is successful, the process will be automated and integrated into a larger software solution. You will be required to fully test the final prototype and supply a fully functional application.
